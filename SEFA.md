# Hackathon Reflection

This hackathon helped me strengthen what I’ve learned by applying it to a real project built from scratch. Working actively within a team taught me what to do and what to avoid in a real development environment.
I gained hands-on experience with team communication, collaborative development using Git, and learned more about project management.
Exploring new technologies and tools used in the project was also very valuable. Overall, working as part of a team was a valuable for me.

# In Hindsight / What I’d Change

If I had more time, I would add a feedback section where users could leave comments and rate the project. I would also develop a blog page and an about us page.
Additionally, structuring the project more around reusable, component based architectures with React could be a more modern and effective approach.
