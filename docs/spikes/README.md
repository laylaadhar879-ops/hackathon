# Spikes

A **spike** is a time-boxed research or investigation task to answer a specific question or explore a technical solution.

## What is a Spike?

Spikes help you:
- Research new technologies or libraries
- Investigate how to solve a problem
- Explore different approaches before committing to one
- Answer questions like "Can we do X?" or "What's the best way to do Y?"

## When to Create a Spike

Create a spike when you need to:
- Learn about a new library or API
- Figure out if something is technically possible
- Compare different solutions
- Understand how a feature should work

## How to Document a Spike

Create a new markdown file in this folder with a descriptive name.

**Example**: `authentication-options.md`, `recipe-api-research.md`, `image-upload-investigation.md`

### Spike Template

```markdown
# Spike: [Title]

**Time Box**: [How long you'll spend - e.g., 2 hours]
